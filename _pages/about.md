About Me
======
I currently work as a Sustainability Engineer at [E-Lab](https://www.e-lab.com.au/our-people) a specialist consultancy at their Sydney Office. With my background in mechanical engineering and thermodynamics I specialise in building simulation to aid in architectural design and optimised outcomes for clients in cost, wellness and carbon impact. I have also worked across other aspects of sustainability including delivering sustainable ratings, energy estimation for compliance, embodied carbon, thermal comfort and daylight assessments. Overall, I relish the opportunity to explore further in sustainability and collaborate with the amazing people in this field.
